=======================
Setting up your SD Card
=======================

The SD we have provided has `NOOBS <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/>`_ with the `Raspbian OS <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>`_ already installed. We have also added the drivers for the touchscreen. `Here <https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/5inch_HDMI_LCD>`_ you can find additional steps to modify the configuration of the touchscreen.

Using an existing Disk Image
============================

1. `Download SDFormatter <https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/>`_ if not installed.
2. Use SDFormatter to format the SD card. Please be careful and make sure you select the correct drive letter.
3. `Download Etcher <https://www.etcher.io>`_ if not installed.
4. Use Etcher to flash the image to the SD card.

   - Please be careful that the correct drive letter is selected.
   - On Mac: if you backed up the image with the method above you might have to change the file extension from ".cdr" to ".iso"

Using NOOBS
===========

To set up a new SD card yourself, we recommend you use NOOBS (New Out Of Box Software). It is an easy installer to get a Pi up and running quickly.

For information on how to set up with NOOBS, use `this guide <https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/2/>`_.
